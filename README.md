### Reporting an issue

If you have found an issue please first have a look at the [previously reported issues](https://github.com/thenativeweb/wolkenkit/issues) to verify whether the issue has already been reported.

If not, [report a new issue](https://github.com/thenativeweb/wolkenkit/issues/new/choose) and provide any steps required to reproduce the issue, as well as the expected and the actual result. Additionally provide the versions of wolkenkit and Docker, and the type and architecture of the operating system you are using.

Ideally you can also include a [short but complete code sample](http://www.yoda.arachsys.com/csharp/complete.html) to reproduce the issue. Anyway, depending on the issue, we know that this is not always possible.

Although wolkenkit is developed using multiple repositories, please report any issues to the [thenativeweb/wolkenkit](https://github.com/thenativeweb/wolkenkit/issues) repository, as this is the primary contact point.

### Asking a question

If you want to ask a question please first have a look at the [previously asked questions at Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/wolkenkit) to verify whether your question has already been asked.

If not, [ask a new question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask) and tag it with `wolkenkit`.

### Getting support

If you need help by the original authors of wolkenkit, e.g. to address issues specific to your environment or project, you may be interested in a paid support plan. For that, feel free to [contact the native web](mailto:hello@thenativeweb.io).

## Finding the code

Since wolkenkit is a distributed application, its code is spread across various repositories. For an overview of the architecture and a list of the repositories, see the [wolkenkit documentation](https://docs.wolkenkit.io/latest/getting-started/understanding-wolkenkit/architecture/).

Additionally, you may want to have a look at these repositories that contain the most important supporting modules:

- [wolkenkit-eventstore](https://github.com/thenativeweb/wolkenkit-eventstore)
- [commands-events](https://github.com/thenativeweb/commands-events)
- [tailwind](https://github.com/thenativeweb/tailwind)

## Running the build

To build this module use [roboter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/roboter).

```shell
$ npx roboter
```

Additionally to the unit tests, there are so-called *story tests*. To run them, use the following command:

```shell
$ npx roboter test-stories
```

## FAQ

### Why do I get an *Error loading extension section V3_ca* message when running the story tests?

If you get the error *Error loading extension section V3_ca* when running the story tests, you have to edit your local OpenSSL configuration. You can find the configuration at `/private/etc/ssl/openssl.cnf`. In this file you have to add the following lines:

```
[ v3_ca ]
basicConstraints = critical,CA:TRUE
```
