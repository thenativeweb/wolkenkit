# wolkenkit-template-chat

wolkenkit-template-chat is a simple messaging application.

The idea was to implement a messaging platform similar to [Slack](https://slack.com/), with the functionality limited to the essentials, i.e. sending and rating messages. The application is used as one of the templates available for newly initialized projects with wolkenkit.
