# Contributor license agreement (CLA)

This CLA is by and between

the native web GmbH
Hauptstraße 8
79359 Riegel am Kaiserstuhl
Germany

- hereinafter referred to as *the native web*

and you

- hereinafter referred to as *contributor*.

## Preamble

We at *the native web* believe that our software, *wolkenkit*, transforms the way you develop cloud-native applications.

To build a vibrant open-source community we have licensed wolkenkit using GNU Affero General Public License, Version 3 (AGPLv3) published by the Free Software Foundation. To also create a sustainable business that reliably backs the open-source model we additionally offer wolkenkit using a proprietary license. For us, open-source and business are not contradictory, but rather form a respectful partnership to create better software.

We value your dedication to improve wolkenkit. Every contribution is important, from code to documentation, from asking questions to providing answers.

We promise that your contribution will be part of the open-source edition, if it gets merged. Additionally, we may also integrate it into the proprietary licensed edition.

Before being able to merge your contribution we need to clarify the legal aspects. That's why we ask you to sign this CLA. If you wonder why this is necessary, have a look at [Why is a CLA necessary?](https://cla.github.com/) provided by GitHub.

The CLA is there to protect your rights as the author of your code and gives us the chance to use your contribution just the way you want it. We want you to fully understand what you are signing, therefore, if you have any questions or comments, feel free to contact us [using email](hello@thenativeweb.io).

Thank you for sharing your time and work with us!
